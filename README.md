# Service Oriented application

This repository is for learning SOA as a better alternative to standard MVC for backend applications.
There is no maven/lombock etc yet so that the basic concepts are gradually introduced.
This is part of the [AUEB coding factory curriculum](https://codingfactory.aueb.gr/).
